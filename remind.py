    Pi Remind
    By John M. Wargo
    www.johnwargo.com

    This application connects to a Google Calendar and determines whether there are any appointments in the next
    few minutes and flashes some LEDs if there are. The project uses a Raspberry Pi 2 device with a Pimoroni
    Unicorn HAT (an 8x8 matrix of bright, multi-colored LEDs) to display an obnoxious reminder every minute, changing
    color at 10 minutes (WHITE), 5 minutes (YELLOW) and 2 minutes (multi-color swirl).

    Google Calendar example code: https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/python
    Unicorn HAT example code: https://github.com/pimoroni/unicorn-hat/tree/master/python/examples

    Updated 2018-12-18 - Added automatic reboot if can't connect after 10 tries.
